> Please see the [SchemaCrawler website](http://www.schemacrawler.com/) for more details.

SchemaCrawler is a free database schema discovery and comprehension tool. SchemaCrawler is available under a number of [licenses](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/license.html).

SchemaCrawler supports almost any database that has a JDBC driver, but for convenience is [bundled with drivers](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/database-support.html) for some commonly used RDBMS systems. SchemaCrawler works with any operating system that supports Java SE 8 or better.

All SchemaCrawler jars are in the [Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3Aus.fatehi%20a%3Aschemacrawler*). They can be used as dependencies in [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) or [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) projects, or with any other build system that supports the Central Repository. [Pre-packaged Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/sualeh/schemacrawler/) are on Docker Hub. [Download releases with tutorials from GitHub.](https://github.com/sualeh/SchemaCrawler/releases)

An (unsupported) back-port of SchemaCrawler to Java  7 is available at [sualeh/SchemaCrawler-Java7-Backport](https://github.com/sualeh/SchemaCrawler-Java7-Backport).

Please get support on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=newest&q=schemacrawler), following the [Guidelines for Support](http://sualeh.github.io/SchemaCrawler/consulting.html).
